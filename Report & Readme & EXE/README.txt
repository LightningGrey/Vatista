Keytoggles are the same as listed in the assignment. using keys 1 through 0

‘1’ = Show scene composited with one deferred light source 
‘2’ = TOGGLE on/off viewing the deferred light volumes 
‘3’ = Draw the Position/Depth Buffer only 
‘4’ = Draw the Normal Buffer only  
‘5’ = Draw the Color/Material buffer only 
‘6’ = Show light accumulation buffer 
‘7’ = Cycle through different light volume meshes 
‘8’ = TOGGLE Post Processing (Cel shading)
‘9’ = TOGGLE Post processing (Motion blur)

All toggles exist in the code (toggles 3-6 will prevent code from working so they're commented out), but only toggles 2 and 7 have visible changes
Toggles also are sensitive


Post-process past exists but is commented out, post-processing effects do not work due to this not working
Main render loop doesn't work, code still exists
